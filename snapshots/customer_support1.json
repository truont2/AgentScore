This is the most important piece of information.\n*   **Check your email (including spam/junk):** Did you receive a confirmation email when you requested the refund? This email often contains information about the expected processing time.\n*   **Consider business days:** If you requested it on a Friday, then Monday would be the first business day.\n\n**When to start being concerned (i.e., when it might become \"negative\"):**\n\n*   If the refund hasn't appeared by the **end of the stated processing time** (e.g., if they said 5 business days and it's been 7).\n*   If you haven't received any communication or confirmation **after 5-7 business days** and no specific timeline was given.\n\nFor now, it's likely just the normal processing time.
