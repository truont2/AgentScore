      "response": "**Recommendation: Flight A ($1200, ANA, direct)**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nBoth Flight A and Flight B are excellent direct flight options with similar flight times (11h 30m vs 11h 45m). The key differentiator is price:\n\n- Flight A: $1200 (saves $200)\n- Flight B: $1400\n\nBoth ANA and JAL are highly reputable Japanese carriers with excellent service, safety records, and comfort. The 15-minute difference in flight time is negligible.\n\n**Cost Analysis:**\nBy choosing Flight A, you save $200 which can be allocated to:\n- Better hotel accommodation (upgrade from APA Hotel to Citadines or Granbell)\n- Activities and dining in Tokyo\n- Transportation (JR Pass, airport transfers)\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nBook Flight A ($1200, ANA) and use the $200 savings to enhance your Tokyo experience with a better hotel or additional activities.",
